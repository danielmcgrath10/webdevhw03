# Bulls and Cows or "4Digits"

## How to run
- This repo uses Yarn as the package manager, so to run it you can use the command: 
```
yarn && yarn start
```
This runs the "yarn" command which downloads all of the packages you need, 
and then calls the "yarn start" command which starts the developmnet server and serves the app.
